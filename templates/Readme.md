# AI Clinic - README

## 🏥 What This Project Does

This is a **simple AI-powered clinic management system** that allows:
- **Patients** to describe health concerns and book appointments
- **Doctors** to manage appointments and use AI assistance for scheduling

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Backend (Flask)
- **Flask**: Web framework
- **Flask-Login**: User authentication 
- **OpenAI API**: AI responses (optional)
- **Python**: Core language

### Frontend (Simple HTML/CSS/JS)
- **HTML**: Page structure
- **CSS**: Styling with CSS variables for themes
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Interactive functionality
- **No complex frameworks**: Easy to understand

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. Patient Flow (`/` → `index.html`)
1. Patient visits the main page
2. Describes health concerns in text area
3. Can use voice input (🎤 button)
4. Submits form → calls `/api/ask`
5. Gets AI response with appointment booking

### 2. Doctor Flow (`/login` → `/clinic`)
1. Doctor logs in with credentials
2. Views dashboard with live appointments
3. Uses AI assistant for schedule management
4. Can speak commands or type instructions

## 🔧 Key Features

### ✅ Already Working
- **Patient appointment booking**
- **Voice recognition** for both patients and doctors
- **Real-time appointment display**
- **AI assistant for doctors**
- **User authentication**
- **Geolocation tracking**

### 🎨 UI Enhancements Added
- **Dark/Light mode toggle** (🌙/☀️ button)
- **Mobile responsive design**
- **Clean, medical-themed styling**
- **Smooth animations and transitions**
- **Better user experience**

## 📱 Responsive Design

The interface automatically adapts to:
- **Desktop**: Full grid layout
- **Tablet**: Adjusted spacing
- **Mobile**: Single column, touch-friendly buttons

## 🔐 Authentication

### Demo Accounts
- **Dr. Lee**: `drlee` / `password123`
- **Dr. Smith**: `drsmith` / `clinicpass`

### How It Works
1. Hardcoded credentials in `app.py`
2. Flask-Login manages sessions
3. Protected routes require login
4. Automatic logout functionality

## 🤖 AI Integration

### Patient AI (`/api/ask`)
- Processes health concerns
- Creates appointment bookings
- Includes location data
- Returns booking confirmation

### Doctor AI (`/api/clinic-ai`)
- Helps with schedule management
- Processes voice commands
- Handles rescheduling requests
- Manages time blocking

## 📊 Data Storage

Currently uses **in-memory storage**:
```python
appointments = []  # Simple list in app.py
doctors = {"drlee": "password123", "drsmith": "clinicpass"}
```

**Note**: Data resets when server restarts. For production, add a database.

## 🎯 Future Enhancement Ideas

### Easy Additions
1. **Database integration** (SQLite/PostgreSQL)
2. **Email notifications**
3. **Calendar integration**
4. **Patient profiles**
5. **Appointment reminders**

### Advanced Features
1. **Multi-choice questionnaires**
2. **Conditional form steps**
3. **File upload for medical records**
4. **Video consultation integration**
5. **Analytics dashboard**

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables (Optional)
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

### 3. Run the Application
```bash
python app.py
```

### 4. Access the Application
- **Patient Interface**: http://localhost:5000
- **Doctor Login**: http://localhost:5000/login
- **Doctor Dashboard**: http://localhost:5000/clinic (after login)

## 🔄 How to Make Changes

### Adding New Pages
1. Create HTML file in `templates/`
2. Add route in `app.py`
3. Follow existing styling pattern

### Modifying Styling
- Edit CSS in the `<style>` sections
- Use CSS variables for consistent theming
- Test on mobile devices

### Adding Features
1. Update HTML structure
2. Add JavaScript functions
3. Create new API endpoints in `app.py`
4. Test thoroughly

## 🎨 Theme System

### CSS Variables Used
```css
:root {
  --bg-color: #ffffff;      /* Background */
  --text-color: #333333;    /* Text */
  --card-bg: #f8f9fa;       /* Cards */
  --border-color: #e0e0e0;  /* Borders */
  --primary-color: #007bff; /* Buttons */
}
```

### Dark Mode
- Automatically switches colors
- Saves preference in localStorage
- Smooth transitions between themes

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Voice Recognition Not Working
- Ensure HTTPS in production
